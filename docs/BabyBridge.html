        Baby Bridge really shows off Baby X's graphics capabilities. The playing surface is quickly assembled ftom an rgba canvas, and the cards imported from another game. It's easy to plsce text and controls over the surface. In this case, we have a "Click Me" button to step the game.

        Baby Bridge's bridge logic is very childish. The comppuer opponents follow simple conventions for bidding, and then for play generally follow the rule that second player play low, third player play high. So it's an acceptable game if you are also a bit of a baby and that's your strength at Bridge. However if you are interested in more serious bridge logic, you are welcome to take Baby Bridge as a framework, and teach him how to finessese, and guess cards based on bidding, and gnerally play well (Without looking at the other cards, which of course are there in memory. That would be cheating.)
