<H1> Baby X Fonts and Strings </H1>
<P>
Baby X strings are treated as UTF-8. For those in
a purely English-speaking environment, that's identical to ASCII. For
those using non-English characters, UTF-8 provides multi-byte encoding,
by exploiting the fact that the top bit of an ASCII value is always clear.
it is important to understand the difference between UTF-8 and the "Unicode
value". Unicode values are are 32-bit set of values, each one of which maps
to a glyph in a human language. UTF-8 is  away of encoding those values
in a string of C chars.
</P>
<P> 
Baby X prints strings internally. That is to say, it renders its own
text, without using the native string drawing applications. Normally
you will not draw rext directly, however. You will use the <A href="BabyXCoreWidgets.html#BBX_Label">
BBX_Label</A> class. 
</P>
<P>
To do this efficiently, Baby X relies on fonts being pre-rasterised. A
few fonts are built into Baby X - the defualt GUI font and the user font.
The default GUI font is used for drawing UI elements, the user font for
when the user enters text. You can however use your own fonts. You get
these fonts into the program with the help of the <A href="https://github.com/MalcolmMcLean/babyxrc">
Baby X resource compiler</A>.

<xmp>
<BabyXRC>
<font src = "Lato-Regular.ttf", name = "lato_regular", points = "12"> </font>
</BabyXRC>
</xmp>
</pre>
<P>
Here's an example of an input script file to the Baby X resource compiler 
that creates a font. All fonts are pre-rasterised, so you have to specify
the point size. If you want two sizes of the same font, you need to
create two font entries. The font is written out as a bitmap_font
structure with the name lato_regular_font. (Lato is an open source
font, relesed under the <A href="OFL.txt">STL licence</A>).
</P>
<pre class=microlight>
/* bitmap font structure */
struct bitmap_font {
  unsigned char width;         /* max. character width */
  unsigned char height;        /* character height */
  int ascent;                  /* font ascent */
  int descent;                 /* font descent */
  unsigned short Nchars;       /* number of characters in font */
  unsigned char *widths;       /* width of each character */
  unsigned short *index;       /* encoding to character index */
  unsigned char *bitmap;       /* bitmap of all characters */
};
</pre>
<P>
Here is the font structure. Most of it is pretty self-explanatory,
the font is held in a bitmap, which is 8-bit alpha only. 
The index member gives a sorted list of the Unicode characters corresponding 
to each entry. So you can convert a Unicode value to a font index value by 
a binary search.
</P>
<H3> Drawing fonts directly </H3>
<P>
Normally you will use a font by passing it to one of the core widgets
as its setfont() argument. You mustn't release fonts until you
have destroyed all widgets that use them, for efficiency reasons
copies are not cached. However you can also draw fonts directly into
an rgba buffer, usually obtained via a call to bbx_canvas_getrgba().
</P>
<pre class=microlight>
int bbx_textwidth(struct bitmap_font *font, char *str, int N);
void bbx_drawstring(unsigned char *rgba, int width, int height, int x, int y, char *str, int N, struct bitmap_font *font, BBX_RGBA col);
int bbx_utf8width(struct bitmap_font *font, char *utf8, int N);
void bbx_drawutf8(unsigned char *rgba, int width, int height, int x, int y, char *utf8, int N, struct bitmap_font *font, BBX_RGBA col);
int bbx_font_getchar(unsigned char *out, struct bitmap_font *font, int ch);
</pre>
<P>
The two functions you are most likely to want are bbx_utf8width(), which gets
the width of a UTF-8 string in pixels, and bbx_drawutf8(), which draws a
UTF-8 string at the requested location. bbx_textwidth() and bbx_drawstring()
take ASCII, and are left in for backwards compatibility. However bbx_drawutf8
cannot handle right-left languages like Hebrew or Arabic. If you want 
access to the character directly, look it up with bbx_font_getchar(), which
takes a Unicode value and returns an index.
</P>
<H3> UTF-8 strings </H3>
<P>
Baby X provides basic operations for operating on UTF-8 strings. You are
unlikely to need these often, since the point of UTF-8 is that it is
mostly transparent to user level code. Strings are just human-readable
portions of text. However you might wantto parse or construct a UTF-8 string
on the fly.
</P>
<pre class=microlight>
int bbx_isutf8z(const char *str);
int bbx_utf8_skip(const char *utf8);
int bbx_utf8_getch(const char *utf8);
int bbx_utf8_putch(char *out, int ch);
int bbx_utf8_Nchars(const char *utf8);
int bbx_utf8_charwidth(int ch);
</pre>
<P>
bbx_isutf8z() checks if a string is a valid, nul terminated, UTF-8 string.
bbx_utf8_skip() gets the number of bytes used to encode the first character
in the string. bbx_uft8_getch() converts the first character in a UTF-8
string to its Unicode value. To write strings, set upa  buffer, and
call bbx_utf8_putch(). This writes a UTF-8 sequence to the buffer, and
returns the number of bytes written. bbx_utf8_Nchars() returns the number
of Unicode values conatined ina UTF-8 string. bbx_utf8_charwidth() returns
the number of UTF-8 bytes needed to encode a Unicode value.
