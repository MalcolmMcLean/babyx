<H1> Baby X Concepts </H3>
<P>
Baby X is an open source, portable GUI toolkit aimed at smaller
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is that Baby X programs will run on any major operating
system, just by linking the correct version of the Baby X library.
Currently we only support Linux (X Windows) and Microsoft Windows,
but the aim is that Baby X programs should be easily portable to 
any environment, simply by rewriting the OS-specific portions oof
the library.
</P>
<P>
The code is separated into several sections. At the lowest level, 
is the operating system specific layer. These are in the directories
"windows" and "linux". Then at the next level is the core library,
in the directory "common". This contains all of the simple widgets 
that can be written portably, plus the portable utility code.
Then there is the widgets library, containing complicated widgets
that are built on top of the other Baby X widgets. Finally we
have the user programs. Some example programs are packaged with
the Baby X distribution to provide a reference code base and to test
how the library stand up to real life.
</P>
<H3> Coding style </H3>
<P>
The code is all written in portable ANSI C, except for the operating
system specific parts. We don't use derived types, most of the variables
are simple ints, doubles, unsigned char, or char *s. We don't use
const because it is not always obvious whether a Baby X function should
make a chnage in an object or not. The structures are mostly opaque,
created on the heap, and passed around by pointer. 
</P>
<P>
The Baby X namespace is BBX_ for structures and internal functions,
and bbx_ for user-callable functions, with a few exceptions such 
as the BABYX connection itself. Every fucntion prefixed BBX_ is
operating system-specific and should not be called by user code.
There is one header for all of the core library, which is "BabyX.h".
This includes windows.h or X11/Xlib.h, so user programs should be
careful not to use sysmbols which clash. 
</P>
<P>
Baby X relies heavily on callback functions. Virtually all the
widgets accept callbacks. Often these can be null because the
sae information can be got by querying the widget. For example,
a BBX_CheckBox can call a callback when it changes state, but
it will usually be easier simply to query its tick state on
dialog close, or if data is required. The callback always passes
back a context pointer, which can be null, but means that
there is no need for globals. Most of the widgets are BBX_Panels,
and hnag widget-specific data off the panels' context pointer.
</P>
<P>
Destruction needs to be explicit and it reverse order of window
hierarchy.
</P>
<H3> Graphics </H3>
<P>
There is a simple graphicssupport library which is used internally
by the core widgets to draw themselves. There is also a complicated
graphicscontext which user programs can use to draw vector-style
graphics. However because all graphics are implemented by drawing
to rgba buffers, any graphics system can work alongside Baby X. 
The graphics context can also be taken and used in non-Baby X
programs.
</P>
<H3> Text and Fonts </H3>
<P>
Text is handled as UTF-8. There is no support for right to left
language such as Hebrew or Arabic, or for composite glyphs. 
Fonts are pre-rasterised, by the Baby X resource compiler.
</P>
<P>
There are two fonts currently packaged with the Baby X core
library, the default gui font and the user font. the user font
is monospaced.
</P>
<H3> Widget design </H3>
<P>
Baby X is a "baby" toolkit. So currently there is no way to
customise the appearance of most of the controls. Everything
is grey, with light coming from the upper left. More customisation
will be added as the library develops. However the goal is
to keep it simple, and consistent.
</P>
<H3> The Baby X Resource Compiler </H3>
<P>
The Baby X recource compiler, babyxrc, is designed to be used
with Baby X programs. It packages assets as C source files
for inclusion in Baby X programs. It's also a treasury of
protable ANSI C code for parsing file formats that can be used
in other projects. Plus the resource compiler is not only
useful for Baby X, you might want it for your embedded
project.
</P>
<H3> User programs </H3>
<P>
There are three "real" user programs, BabyBridge - a contract bridge
game, BabyPerlin, a Perlin noise texture generator, and WordCatch,
a game in which you try to spell words by catching falling letters.
WordCatch shows off the simplicity of Baby X's graphics. It simply
creates a full canvas covering the window, then draws rgba objects
to it. 
</P>   
<H3> Directions </H3>
<P>
Current priorities are to get the documentation ready, and to improve
the appearance of the Baby X widgets. The next thing is to get the
audio system working. As a longer term goal, it should also be ported
to Apple. We're always glad to receive help, feedback,
suggestions, or Baby X programs that users have written. 
</P>
<P>
Enjoy Baby X.
