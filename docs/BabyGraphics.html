<H1> Baby X Graphics </H1>
<P>
Baby X graphics are based on the BBX_Canvas element. Essentially a
canvas is a blank space on which to draw graphics. You do the actual
drawing with the <A href="BabyGraphicsSupport.html">Baby X graphics
support library</A>, the Baby X graphics context, or a graphics library
of your choice.
</P>
You create a BBX_Canvas with:

</P>
<div class=microlight>
BABYX *bbx; /* Connection to the Baby X sever */
BBX_Panel *parent; /* Parent window of canvas */
int width = 256;
int height = 100; 

BBX_Canvas *can = bbx_canvas(bbx, parent, width, height, bbx_color("white"));
</div>
<P>
You then have to lay it out in the parent's "layout" callback
</P>
<div class=microlight>
void layout(void *obj, int width, int height)
{
  APP *app =  obj;
  BABYX *bbx = app->bbx;
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  int width = 256;
  int height = 100;

  bbx_setpos(bbx, app->can, x, y, width, height); 
}
</div>
<P>
Now we are ready to draw. We can do this in response to ammouse click,
or from the tail of our "layout" function.  
</P>
<div class=microlight>
BBX_Canvas *can; /* the canvas we created */
int width, height;
unsigned char *rgba = bbx_canvas_rgba(can, &width, &height);
/* drawing code goes here */

bbx_canvas_flush(can);
</div>
<P>
We obtain the rgba buffer to the canvas, draw on it by direct
memory addressing, and then flush it to the canvas object. We
shouldn't use the rgba bufffer after calling bbx_canvas_flush().
There is no need to wait on a "draw" event or to regenerate the
canvas on demand, and you can draw on it in response to any
Baby X event.
</P>
<P>
This system means that Baby X programs can use any graphical system,
as long as it can draw to rgba buffers. The rgba buffer is always
32 bit rgba, in that order in memory, and it is always aligned so 
it can alias to a 32 bit type.
</P>
<H3> Provided Graphics </H3>
<P>
Baby X comes with two graphics systems, the basic system designed for
drawing <A href="BabyGraphicsSupport.html">simple graphics</A>, and the graphics context system designed
for drawing quality 2D graphics. The simple graphics system is
a list of functions that operate on rgba buffers. The graphics
context system requires you to create a graphics context on the buffer,
issue drawing commands to it, then destroy it. Finally you flush
the buffer to the canvas. The functions can also be used for off-screen
drawing to memory buffers, of course.
