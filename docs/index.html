<H1> Baby X </H1>
  Still building, but nearly there now.
  <P>
    Baby X is the brand new GUI toolkit on the block. It's a cut down, "Baby" toolkit designed for small programs.
    
  </P>
<P>
  Why not dive straight in, and explore <A href="BabyXHelloWorld.html"> Baby X Hello World</A>?
  Or take a look at how Baby X does <A href="BabyGraphics.html">graphics</A>?
  Or start exploring the Baby X internals, with <A href="BabyPanels.html">Baby X Panels </A>?
</P>
<P>
  For those a bit more interested, look at the root <A href="BabyXObject.html">
  Baby X Object</A>. Or if yu are ready to start coding, you'll need a list
of the <A href="BabyXCoreWidgets.html"> Baby X core widgets</A>. For something
a bit more complicated, look at <A href="BabyMenusAndPopups.html"> menus and
 popups</A>. Or try Baby X's <A href="BabyFontsAndStrings.html">fonts and strings</A>
Then Baby X wouldn't be Baby X without the <A href="BabyColours.html"> baby colours </A>. 
</P>
<P>
 Then for those more philosphically inclined, read about <A href="BabyXConcepts.html"> 
Baby X concepts </A>.

<P>
  Lots more coming up shortly.
