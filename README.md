# Baby X 

The mini GUI toolkit that lets you port programs between Windows
and Linux.
 
Check out our (https://malcolmmclean.github.io/babyx/ "webpages")

We're now using CMake. (https://cmake.org/ "Link"). To build with CMake, create a directory
called "build" under the repository. Then type

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
```

or

```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
```

You can still take Baby X sources and drop them into your own
projects if you find that more convenient.
