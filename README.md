# Baby X 

The mini GUI toolkit that lets you port programs between Windows
and Linux.
 
Check out our <a href="https://malcolmmclean.github.io/babyx/"> webpages</a>

We're now using CMake. (<a href="https://cmake.org/">Link</a>). To build with CMake, create a directory
called "build" under the repository. Then type

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ..
```

or

```
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
```

You can still take Baby X sources and drop them into your own
projects if you find that more convenient.

Check out the /topic branches for more Baby programs, currently there is BabyLife and BabyImageViewer.
